				<h2>2006 Vestal, New York</h2>
				<p>Playing clarinet with Adam in band, I doubt there are many high school students who try to do as much as he does. With his music alone, he also plays violin in orchestra, takes piano and clarinet lessons, plays clarinet with the Binghamton Youth Symphony Orchestra, and joined the Vestal Voices this year. He is also really serious with his coursework, already having skipped a year in advanced math and skipping a year in Spanish while taking AP physics as a sophomore (and let's not forget AP Euro). I have to admit, Adam is a bit, well, intense, but he has a lot of energy and enthusiasm. He is very serious when it comes to mathletes, that's for sure, and still finds time for other clubs like peace club. It's a lot of fun to hang out at his house, but don't think he will be any less serious when going against you in Guitar Hero!

				<h2>2007 Wrocław, Poland</h2>
				<p>Adam came to us in Wrocław last August in 2006. His Polish is not super but he's still trying to figure out what he can. He is sometimes very funny and I think that he really likes our city. He tried to help with translation on our website in international competition but Polish language is very difficult. He likes to take lessons in piano and clarinet and sings in Guadium the choir of the university of Wrocław. He is good at maths, German and informatics. I don't think that I understand Americans very well but Adam always says that he is not a normal American. I think that you have to be brave to live somewhere without knowing the language.

				<h2>2009 Washington, District of Columbia</h2>
				<p>One of the most pleasant and often amusing colleagues I've had this year would have to be Adam Davis. He is one of the few math majors at The Catholic University of America and one of the even fewer physics majors. This coming summer he will have the opportunity to intern at NASA, but my jealousy does not stem from his prospects so much as the contrast it presents to my summer internship, which will most unfortunately be unpaid. He is instrumental in keeping life in the Honors program and dorm interesting, especially in that neither he nor his roommate are known for having subdued personalities. Adam is a refreshing breath of fresh air in our narrow-minded university with his open-mindedness. He indeed has the best of intentions and attempted, perhaps naïvely, to effect change through becoming an elected representive to SAGA, our farce of a student government, though I think he achieves much more with his success in Model UN.

				<h2>2015 Portland, Oregon</h2>
				<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my fictional narratives, derived in large part but never in full from what I have heard over the years from friends and other acquaintances. I hope this has painted a picture of some of my life experience over the past decade. I write this currently living in Portland, Oregon, having moved to the Pacific Northwest in pursuit of new experiences and opportunities. I am eager to meet as many new people as possible, often by engaging in various activities like playing Ingress, joining a running group, playing board games, or meeting up with a bridge group. I am fortunate to have my younger sister already having lived in the city for the past year and to have supportive parents, who offered to pay for my attendance at The Tech Academy, a boot camp to train junior software developers. Of course, as with anything, there are difficulties with this chapter of my life here in Portland, but no matter the obstacle that I face, I will persevere and emerge victorious. <i>This journey has already begun, but it is far from ending!</i>
